<h1>Get Ready</h1>

<h2>Why are we moving to Canvas?</h2>

<p>In early 2016 the Board of Governors for the State University System of Florida selected Canvas as the preferred common LMS for our universities.  Though adoption of Canvas is currently on an opt-in basis, the Board of Governors has strongly encouraged universities to carefully consider the pros and cons of transitioning over to this new system.</p>

<p>Florida State University decided to create an Opt-In Feasibility Workgroup, which was tasked with evaluating the benefits and features of the Canvas LMS, as well as any limitations, to determine what course of action would best meet the needs of our students and faculty.  The LMS workgroup carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of a system transition in terms of usability, features, third-party product support, faculty adoption time and effort, training challenges, cost, and support. The group participated in product demonstrations from both Canvas and Blackboard, surveyed faculty for feedback and concerns, and carefully reviewed the budgetary impact. Office of Distance Learning technical staff performed an independent review of Canvas and certified that our procedures for course creation, enrollment, and grade submission are all compatible with the system. Ultimately, the LMS workgroup agreed that the functionality and ease of use offered by Canvas would best serve our faculty and students.</p>

<h2>When is this happening?</h2>

<p>Here’s a quick summary of what you need to know:</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2017</strong>: We intend to run a Canvas Pilot for select courses and instructors.  If you are interested in being part of this pilot group, **********************[need email]let us know[/link]**********************!</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2017</strong>: Release official Canvas environment to all faculty, staff, and students for optional use and for development of Spring 2018 courses.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2018</strong>: All active courses will now be taught in Canvas (except College of Medicine’s yearlong courses).</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2018</strong>: FSU <strong>Blackboard system closes on July 1, 2018</strong>.  Anything you want from Blackboard<strong><em>must</em></strong> be transferred over before this date.  College of Medicine will fully transition to Canvas at this time.</p>

<p>For more detailed information, See our <a href="../timeline">projected timeline</a> for a breakdown of the Learning Management System transition.</p>

<h2>How do I prepare for Canvas?</h2>

<p><em>Florida State University is set to transition to the Canvas learning management system (LMS) and away from the Blackboard LMS by the start of the Spring 2018 semester.</em></p>

<h3>First of all, don't panic</h3>

<p>The switch from Blackboard to Canvas will require some clicking around at first, but you will find the change of scenery to be most refreshing. What we have found:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Canvas's interface is cleaner –  <a href="screenshot-comparison.html">check out our side-by-side screenshot comparison</a>!</li>
    <li>The Canvas user experience is more consistent</li>
    <li>Canvas offers the same core functionality (<a href="improvements.html">with some improvements</a>!) and third party integrations that Blackboard currently provides</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to prepare</h3>

<p>Students will find the software especially easy to learn, but we suggest instructors take the following steps as they prepare for the LMS transition:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Watch Instructure's series of <a href="https://resources.instructure.com/courses/31">introduction videos</a></li>
    <li>Complete Instructure's <a href="https://resources.instructure.com/courses/445>2-3 hour instructor basics course"</a></li>
    <li>Read through our <a href="https://support.campus.fsu.edu/kb/article/704-canvas-crosswalk">Canvas Crosswalk article</a> for a full list of features</li>
    <li>Check out our <a href="../resources">anticipated FAQs</a></li>
    <li>Stay tuned for more news, training opportunities, and resources!</li>
</ol>

<p>We recommend that you begin corralling all course files and resources you are currently using in Blackboard and wish to use in Canvas as soon as possible. There is no great rush for you to do this – again, don’t panic, there IS enough time to do this before Spring 2018.  We make this recommendation in order to help smooth the transition process for you as you create your Canvas course sites.  It may be helpful to store files and a word document detailing the resources you would like to use in a folder on your computer and/or a zip drive as you gradually learn more about Canvas and its instructional possibilities.</p>
