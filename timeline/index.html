    <h2>Course Migration</h2>
    
    <p><strong>We recommend that you begin corralling all course files and resources you are currently using in Blackboard as soon as possible</strong> and storing them in folders on your computer or a zip drive in preparation for migrating your materials over to Canvas.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, we have not found a way to consistently or easily migrate Blackboard course site content into Canvas. On the few occasions that we have been able to move content over, it has come over in a format that is un-editable or has had other problems.  We have had the most promising results from bringing over tests and question pools, but again, these are mixed results and we cannot guarantee that content copied over directly from Blackboard will function as it ought to in Canvas. <strong>The best option we can recommend at present is to re-build your course site from scratch within the Canvas framework</strong>. This way you will not only gain familiarity with Canvas, but will also be far, far less likely to encounter broken items in your course site mid-semester. <strong><a href = "https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-2685" target="_blank">Once you have a course built out in Canvas, it will be much easier to copy that content over into a new Canvas course site</a> at the start of future semesters</strong>. We apologize for this significant inconvenience.</p>
    
    <p>Feeling dismayed at having to re-build your course site in a new system? Don’t panic: we have <a href = "https://support.campus.fsu.edu/kb/article/703-how-do-i-prepare-for-canvas" target="_blank">a guide to help you quickly prepare for the transition</a>.</p>
