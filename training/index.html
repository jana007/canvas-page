    <h1>Training</h1>
    <p>Beginning in Summer 2017, our office will offer a variety of Canvas training sessions for instructors.  These sessions will be held at the Office of Distance Learning’s Faculty Development Lab (Suite C-3500 University Center C) and throughout campus by request.  We will also provide instructors a quick and easy way to <a href = "http://fsuodl.setmore.com/">schedule one-on-one consultations</a> with our Instructional Development staff or Technical Support staff for personal walkthroughs.</p>
    
    <h2>Canvas Workshop Series</h2>
    <p>We are actively developing a new workshop series to help instructors fully prepare for the transition to Canvas.  Each workshop will be split into two, 2-hour parts.  The first part (i.e., 1a, 2a) will concentrate on front-end Canvas training and the second part (i.e., 1b, 2b) will cover best practices and overarching strategies, as listed below:</p>
    
  <table>
    <tr>
        <td><h4>Overview and Getting Started</h4></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
  
  
  </table>
    
    <h2>Departmental training requests</h2>
    <p>If you would like to reserve a time and date for a training session at your department, please contact John Braswell at <a href = "mailto:jbraswell@campus.fsu.edu">jbraswell@campus.fsu.edu</a> or <phone>850-645-0469</phone>. <em>We can begin scheduling training in May 2017</em>.</p>
    <p>We also recommend that you peruse the resources listed on our <a href = "/cpage/get-ready/">Get Ready</a> and <a href = "/cpage/resources/">Resources</a>  pages to familiarize yourself with Canvas as much as possible.</p>
